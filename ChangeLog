2013-01-25:
* Added autogen.sh script in main dir. Just type ./autogen.sh for build all.
* Logging functions changed from level to class system. The advantage of this
  system is that different classes can be easily mixed together.

  and ALL for just all messages.

2013-01-24:

	3. default configuration (hard coded)

2013-01-17:
* Initial release
